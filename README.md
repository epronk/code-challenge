# Code Challenge Instructions

Write a program that transforms `data.json` into `data-transformed.json`. Have a look at `example-output.json` to show how the data should be transformed.

## General Approach and Assumptions

- Solution should be implemented in C#, Swift, or C++.
- Read JSON `data.json` from current directory, convert data, write `data-transformed.json` to current directory.
- Solution should build and run with a single CLI command or via opening a project in an IDE like Visual Studio or Xcode and selecting 'Run' or equivalent.
- Thirdparty dependencies should be kept to a minimum and must be fetched and installed as a part of the build process.
- Solution should write output file directly to project directory unless otherwise specified.

## Criteria

Your work will be evaluated primarily on:

- Consistency of coding style.
- Idiomatic language use.
- Use of asynchronous features if supported by your language of choice.
- Correct and complete unit test coverage.
- General quality of code and technical communication.

## How to submit your work

 1. Fork this project on github.
 2. Update this README.md file with instructions on how to build/test/run your solution.
 3. When you're finished, send us the URL of your public repository.
